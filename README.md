## Automated ELK Stack Deployment
The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.
![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram] (Images/diagram_filename.png)
These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the __YAML___ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.   - _TODO: elk_playbook.yml
This document contains the following details:
-	Description of the Topology- Access Policies
-	ELK Configuration  - Beats in Use
-	Machines Being Monitored
-	How to Use the Ansible Build
### Description of the Topology
The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.
Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _effective___, in addition to restricting traffic __Access_ to the network. - _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? They prevent unwanted or unauthorized traffic from reaching the  application. 
What is the advantage of a jump box?_ They add a security layer to the web servers preventing them from being exposed to the public.
Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the __configuration files___ and system _files___.
-	_TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_They watch for Log files or log 
events
-	_TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_They record Metrics from on going services on the server
The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator] (http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.
| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System | |----------|----------|------------|------------------| | Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            | | Web-1    | Webserver| 10.0.0.11  | Linux            | | Web-2    | Webserver| 10.0.0.12  | Linux            | | Web-3    | Webserver| 10.0.0.13  | Linux            |
| VM-ELK   | Webserver| 10.3.0.4   | Linux            |
### Access Policies
The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 
Only the _Jump-box-Provisioner____ machine can accept connections from the
Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses: - _TODO: 172.56.11.249
Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jumpbox_____.
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? My personal computer  What was its IP address?_172.56.11.249
A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.
| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses | |----------|---------------------|----------------------| | Jump Box | Yes                 | My Home IP           |
| Web-1    | No                  |  172.56.11.249       |            
| Web-2    | No                  |  172.56.11.249       |                           
| VM_ELK   | Yes(http)           |  My Home IP          |           
                     
### Elk Configuration     
Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because... - _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with 
Ansible?_ It is flexible because it allows changes to be made within any of the VMs associated with it.
The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. .
1) Install Docker.io 2)Install python3-pip 3)Install Docker Python Module 4) Download and launch a Docker web container 5)Download and launch a docker web container. - ...
The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
-	_TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_10.0.0.1   10.0.0.11   10.0.0.12   10.0.0.13 10.0.0.4   
We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
-	_TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_Filebeat and Metricbeat
These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
-	_TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._
Filebeat monitors log files and log events. Example: Inputs and harvesters. While Metricbeat looks out  for any information in the file system which has been manipulated.
### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 
SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
-	Copy the _ansible configuration____ file to __run playbooks___.
-	Update the _ansible host____ file to include...
-	Run the playbook, and navigate to _Jumpbox___ to check that the installation worked as expected.
_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
-	_Which file is the playbook? The elk-playbook.yml
 Where do you copy it?_
-	_Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific
machine? elk-playbook.yml file
 How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_ By using the IPs of the respective servers.
-	_Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://[ElkProject1VM-ip]:5601/app/kibana
_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run 
to download the playbook, update the files, etc._ ansible-playbook elk-playbook.yml
